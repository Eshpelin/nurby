## Batch 1 (PRs 23488–23304)

### P0 — Security

#### [#23478] ffmpeg export args: blocklist → allowlist · `record` · PARTIAL → issue
Frigate's blocklist on user-supplied ffmpeg export args was bypassable (stream-specifier
filters, scheme-less protocols, `tee`/preset/`-/option` file access), enabling arbitrary file
read/write + SSRF. They switched to a structural **allowlist** of encoder flags + safe filters.
**Nurby:** `conversation_clip.py` and `agent/analyzer.py` pass `Recording.file_path` into ffmpeg
through a permissive `_resolve_path` fallback, and there is no ffmpeg-arg allowlist. SSRF was a
deliberate skip (overnight-review memory). **Action:** allowlist ffmpeg flags; force file paths
through `shared/paths` containment; block private-network SSRF on `http` stream/snapshot URLs.
**P0 · M.** Partly addressed by the stream-URL fix below; remainder tracked as a GitHub issue.

### P1 — Reliability

#### [#23352] Stream-URL scheme validation (+rtsps://) · `config` · ✅ FIXED this batch
Frigate added `rtsps://` to camera URL validation. Investigating revealed nurby had **no
stream-URL scheme validation at all**, so `file:///etc/passwd` and `http://127.0.0.1/...` were
accepted → arbitrary file read + SSRF. **Shipped:** `validate_stream_url()` in
`shared/schemas.py` — a stream-type-aware scheme allowlist (rtsp/rtsps for rtsp+webcam,
http/https for mjpeg/snapshot/hls), passing through path types (usb/file), rejecting
`file://`/`gopher://`/`dict://` and cross-type schemes. 14/14 checks pass. Tests:
`tests/test_stream_url_validation.py`.

#### [#23475] PTZ autotracking crash on non-finite distance · `ptz` · VERIFY → issue
Frigate's autotracking divided by a tracker distance that could be NaN/inf and crashed. Nurby's
**object** tracker (`tracker.py`) is already guarded, **but** nurby has a PTZ smart-track
subsystem (`ptz_smart_track_*`, `schemas.py:141`) whose move math (`gain*distance`, deadzone,
max_speed) was not inspected. **Action:** audit the smart-track controller; clamp + skip move on
non-finite pan/tilt/zoom deltas. **P1 · S.**

### P2 — Feature parity

#### [#23378, #23383, #23359, #23307] Motion search + review items · `review` · MISSING → issue
Frigate has a **review** subsystem (alerts/detections as "review items") and **motion search**
(scrub a time range by where/when motion occurred). Nurby has Alerts/Detections tabs and a
timeline but no motion-search/scrubbing. See `initiatives/motion-search-and-review.md`. **P2 · L.**

#### [#23387] Hide camera from review feed · `review` · PARTIAL → issue
Second visibility flag: hide a camera from the review/alerts feed independently of the dashboard
hide; recording continues. Nurby's camera-wall hide (commit `b870614`) only covers the dashboard.
**Action:** per-camera `exclude_from_review` flag. **P2 · S.**

### P2/P3 — Smaller items (backlog, not separately filed)

- **[#23482] Lazy GenAI provider init** · `genai` · VERIFY · P2/S — Frigate tolerates a GenAI
  provider that fails on initial load and retries lazily. Check `vlm.py`: does a bad provider key
  crash the perception worker at startup or degrade gracefully?
- **[#23365] ONVIF PasswordText auth** · `discovery` · VERIFY · P3/S — support both PasswordText
  and PasswordDigest WS-Security in `discovery/onvif.py`.
- **[#23339] Clone camera settings** · `api` · MISSING · P3/S — duplicate a camera's config
  (minus stream_url/credentials) to speed multi-camera setup.
- **[#23453] Recording keyframe analysis in probe** · `record` · MISSING · P3/M — ffprobe-based
  keyframe-interval readout; warn on long GOP / smart-codec recordings.
- **[#23393] ffmpeg 8 by default** · `deps` · VERIFY · P3/S — check the ffmpeg version baked into
  nurby images; v8 brings decode/hwaccel improvements.
- **[#23310] MP4 export chapters** · `record` · MISSING · P3/S — chapter markers on export.

### Recorded as HAVE / N/A (checked, no action)

- **[#23457] Chat tool calling + prompt fix** — HAVE. Our agent loop already re-includes tool
  calls each turn, jsonschema-validates, and falls back gracefully on all providers.
- **[#23326] Restore runtime state on restart** — HAVE. DB-driven config persists toggles.
- **[#23445] ZMQ subscription narrowing** — N/A. Nurby uses Redis streams + DB poll, not ZMQ.
- **[#23306] Profiles fixes**, **[#23404] reference config** — N/A. Tied to YAML provisioning.
- **[#23324] classifier trainset script**, **[#23476] API auth docs spec** — N/A / HAVE.

## Batch 2 (PRs 23295–23172)

### P1 — Security (architectural — issue filed, NOT auto-fixed)

#### [#23256, #23294] Per-user camera access control · `comms`/`review` · VULNERABLE → issue
Frigate filters **outbound WebSocket broadcasts** and **review/list results** by each recipient's
camera access. Nurby does neither on the main app surface:
- `services/api/ws.py` (`_deliver_local`/`broadcast`/`relay_loop`) pushes every event/detection to
  every connected client. Guardian alerts also broadcast to all.
- List endpoints (`events.py`, `recordings.py`, `observations.py`, `cameras.py`) return **all**
  cameras' data to any authenticated user. Only the Guardian surface is scoped.
This is likely **by design for the single-owner V1**, but it blocks any multi-user/restricted-view
feature and is a data-leak the moment a non-admin account exists. **Deliberately not auto-fixed**:
it needs a user→camera ACL model; merging a half-baked one unsupervised could break the app. See
`initiatives/camera-access-control.md`. **P1 · L.**

### P1 — Reliability

#### [#23172] Filesystem TOCTOU / transient-stat crashes · `record` · ✅ FIXED this batch
Frigate hardened `os.stat`/`exists`+`getsize` flows that crash on transient FS errors
(`Errno 121 Remote I/O`) on network mounts. Nurby had the same unguarded idiom in
`guardian/video.py:44,62` and `conversation_clip.py:158`. **Shipped:** `shared.paths.safe_getsize()`
(guarded, TOCTOU-free) + swapped 4 call sites (also `ingestion/stream.py` recording save now
persists even if the size stat hiccups). Tests: `tests/test_safe_getsize.py`. **P1 · S.**

### P2 — Feature

#### [#23281] Support reasoning / "thinking" models · `genai` · PARTIAL → issue
Frigate added dynamic-thinking-model support. Nurby's `vlm.py`/agent call Claude + OpenAI (which
expose thinking budgets) but don't set thinking params or strip reasoning tokens from outputs.
**Action:** handle thinking/reasoning params + token accounting for reasoning models. **P2 · M.**

### P3 / HAVE / N/A (checked, recorded)

- **[#23261] nginx admin cache leak** — SAFE (no nginx proxy_cache). But the **new** dashboard
  `widget_proxy.py` cache is keyed by `widget_id` only, not user → minor cross-user reuse. Filed P3.
- **[#23265] Credential redaction** — SAFE. Camera creds are Fernet-stored, separate from
  `stream_url`; the authed URL is never logged.
- **[#23206] Semantic chat query** — HAVE. Agent already does pgvector semantic search.
- **[#23188] OpenVINO multi-GPU**, **[#23190] Intel stats**, **[#23251] go2rtc pane**,
  **[#23287/76/70] debug replay**, **[#23264] move_preview_frames** — N/A (no OpenVINO/Intel/go2rtc;
  Nurby uses MediaMTX).
- Deferred (opaque "Misc fixes"/UI tweaks, revisit if a theme needs them): #23295, #23279, #23258,
  #23238, #23235, #23217, #23201, #23186, #23177, plus settings/UI tweaks.

## Batch 3 (PRs 23164–22984)

### P1 — Reliability

#### [#22984] No timeout on async ffmpeg subprocesses · `util` · ✅ FIXED this batch
Frigate enforced a python-level timeout on probe subprocesses (a stalled stream hangs the worker
forever). Nurby's `agent/analyzer.py` (frame extract) and `conversation_clip._run_ffmpeg` awaited
`communicate()` with **no timeout**. **Shipped:** wrapped both in `asyncio.wait_for` + kill-and-reap
on timeout (analyzer 20s, clip 120s); clip returns sentinel `124`. `webcam_bridge` left long-lived
(it's a supervised restart loop). Tests: `tests/test_ffmpeg_timeout.py`. (ffprobe itself is unused.)

### P1 — Security (reinforces existing issue #40)

#### [#23164, #22987] Cross-camera media safety / camera access fixes · `api` · VULNERABLE
More evidence for the per-user camera ACL gap: media-serving + access enforcement are not
per-user scoped. Folded into `initiatives/camera-access-control.md` (issue #40). No new issue.

### Accuracy — verified clean (important non-finding)

#### [#23123] BGR vs RGB to the face detector · `data_processing` · HAVE
Frigate was silently feeding RGB to a BGR-trained detector (degraded confidence). **Audited
nurby and it is correct**: InsightFace gets BGR (`faces.py:74`), CLIP converts BGR→RGB
(`vlm_gate.py:145`), EasyOCR uses grayscale (`plates.py:79`), YOLO gets BGR (ultralytics handles).
No change — verified rather than assumed.

### P3 backlog (not separately filed)

- **[#23096] Ollama Cloud `api_key` auth** — add optional bearer key to the Ollama VLM provider.
- **[#22996] Min-length nudge for VLM scene captions** — push the VLM toward detailed descriptions.
- **[#23052, #23310] MP4 export chapter markers**, **[#23034] download incident as evidence zip**
  (VERIFY nurby evidence export), **[#22993] face-recognition perf** — revisit in topical passes.
- N/A: #23118/#23040 ROCm, #23108 Intel stats, #23099 debug-replay jobs.

---

## Batch 4 (PRs 22980–22814) — coverage batch, no code change

Low yield: dominated by Intel/OpenVINO/ROCm, dependency bumps, docs, i18n, and frontend tweaks
(all N/A or skip for nurby). **No fix forced** — none of the substantive items was a clean,
high-confidence change safe to merge unattended. Worth a later look (backlog / VERIFY):

- **[#22887] Manual events caught by motion config** · `record` · P3/S — ensure manually- or
  API-triggered events bypass `recording_mode=on_motion` gating.
- **[#22971] Stream probe fallback** · `video` · P3/M — graceful fallback/reconnect when the
  primary stream probe fails.
- **[#22818] UTF-8 ONVIF preset names** · `ptz` · P3/S — verify `discovery/onvif.py` decodes
  non-ASCII preset names correctly.
- **[#22880] Deferred enrichment processor** · `data_processing` · P3/M — move expensive
  enrichment off the hot path (compare to nurby `vlm_queue`/enrichment workers).
- **[#22915/#22867] Export progress + improvements**, **[#22963] camera-wizard polish** — UI passes.
- **[#22894] python-multipart bump** — check nurby's pinned version for the same CVE separately.

---

## Batch 5 (PRs 22799–22673) — coverage batch, no code change

Yield still low (genai refactors, Intel/MemryX/go2rtc/llama.cpp, dep bumps, docs, UI tweaks).
Two checks worth recording:

- **[#22689] numpy box coords not JSON-serializable** · `data_processing` · **HAVE** — audited
  and nurby is clean: every numpy value is cast to native python at the vision boundary
  (`detector.py:235-256`, `plates.py:171-181`, `faces.py:86-90`), and `ws.py` uses
  `json.dumps(default=str)` as a net. Verified, not assumed.
- **[#22710] Role-based auth on WS message handler** · `comms` · VULNERABLE — reinforces the
  per-user camera ACL gap; folded into issue #40 (no new issue).

Backlog / VERIFY: **[#22698]** DST-safe time windows (digest/preview tz math), **[#22732]**
zone/mask editor UX, **[#22787/#22733/#22683]** frontend dep CVE audit (lodash/path-to-regexp),
**[#22673]** secondary-pipeline cadence, **[#22685]** ONNX warm-up (only matters once GPU lands).
N/A: MemryX, go2rtc, llama.cpp, MQTT, Intel stats.

---

## Batch 6 (PRs 22664–22540) — coverage batch, no code change

Region heavy with mypy/typing, hardware-accel (Axera/ROCm/CUDA/DEIMv2/MemryX), deps, i18n, and
genai/UI churn. Two security/reliability items checked:

- **[#22607] Arbitrary ffmpeg read/write** · `record` · PARTIAL → reinforces **issue #35** (P0).
  Same class as #23478. Added a comment to #35 with the concrete approach (path containment +
  `-protocol_whitelist file` on local-file ffmpeg inputs). Not merged unattended — risky without
  testing against real recordings.
- **[#22641] Export deadlock from `preexec_fn`** · `record` · **N/A** — nurby has no `preexec_fn`
  anywhere; it uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`, so it is not exposed to the fork-in-threaded
  -process mutex deadlock.

Backlog/VERIFY: **[#22631]** split nurby's large `stream.py` (maintainability), **[#22557]**
process watchdog/restart-on-hang, **[#22556]** continuous GenAI camera-monitor loop vs nurby
summary/interval, **[#22599]** notification edge cases, **[#22548/#23393]** ffmpeg version in
nurby images.

## Batch 7 (PRs 22538–22438) — a real fix + two scrutinized false-positives

A bug-bash region in Frigate. Most of the 22462–22468 cluster is birdseye/GPU (N/A for nurby).

### P1 — Security · ✅ FIXED this batch
**[#22523] Mutating endpoints not admin-gated** · `api`. Found `PATCH /cameras/{id}` (edits
`stream_url`/`username`/`password`/`auth_token`) and `PATCH /providers/{id}` (edits `api_key`)
using `get_current_user`, while their **create/delete siblings already require admin** — a
non-admin could rewrite camera credentials / provider API keys (privilege escalation). **Shipped:**
both PATCH endpoints now `require_admin`; verified via FastAPI route introspection. Remaining
endpoint sweep tracked as issue #46. Cross-camera media/timeline auth (#22522/#22530) → issue #40.

### Scrutinized and rejected (the audit over-flagged; I verified before acting)
- **[#22500] SQL injection** — **HAVE/SAFE**. The flagged `column.ilike(f"%{x}%")` calls bind the
  pattern as a **parameter** (the f-string builds a python string, not SQL). The lone `text(f"…")`
  (`analyzer.py`) uses a hardcoded `WHERE` + bound params. No injection. I did **not** "fix" these
  (would be churn / could break search). LIKE-wildcard widening is handled by `escape_like`.
- **[#22470] PTZ div-by-zero** — **HAVE/SAFE**. `ptz_tracker.py` clamps velocity and guards with
  `max(1, w/h)`; no norm division. This verifies the old issue #36 as a non-issue → **#36 closed**.

### Backlog / VERIFY
- **[#22469]** orphaned snapshot/thumbnail cleanup on camera/event delete · P3.
- **[#22472]** variable-shadowing dropping track updates, **[#22471]** operator-precedence
  always-true, **[#22474]** return-vs-raise, **[#22475]** parse-before-status, **[#22473]** WS leak
  on WebRTC cleanup — generic bug patterns to grep for in nurby · P3 each.
- **[#22537]** shareable timestamped footage deep-link · P3.

---

## Batch 8 (PRs 22426–22295) — one perf fix

### P2 — Performance · ✅ FIXED this batch
**[#22426] Blocking calls stall the async event loop** · `api`. `ollama_deploy.get_ollama_status`
awaited a sync `_get_system_ram_gb()` that shells out to `sysctl` (up to 5s) directly in the
handler — stalling **all** API requests meanwhile. **Shipped:** wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`.
Remaining blocking file I/O (`persons.upload_face`, `system.trigger_update`, `devices` read) and
unchecked `cv2.imencode` in background workers → issue #48.

### Verified HAVE (checked, no change)
- **[#22331] Missing-preview graceful 404** — nurby media endpoints all use `resolve_inside` +
  `exists` → clean 404. **[#22336] delete cameras**, **[#22323] GenAI embeddings/semantic search** —
  already present.
- **[#22385] Push notifications by camera access**, **[#22347] motion-previews filter** → folded
  into issues #40 and #37 respectively.

### Backlog/VERIFY
- **[#22352]** recordings/calendar API perf (indexing/pagination), **[#22393]** wrong exception
  class in subprocess except, **[#22375]** snapshot query params after event end, **[#22416/#22308]**
  LPR moving-vehicle handling + filter ordering · P3 each. N/A: nginx http/2, go2rtc, RKNN, Intel/GPU deps.

---

## Batch 9 (PRs 22294–22103) — coverage batch, no code change

Feature/deps/version-churn region (0.18 early work, GenAI refactors, zone-editor UX, AXERA/Coral/
birdseye N/A, many dep bumps). Reinforces two existing themes, no new fix:

- **[#22253] Improve motion review + add motion search** → the implementation of issue **#37**
  (motion search initiative). **[#22277/#22255]** motion region/threshold config also there.
- **[#22226] Hide hidden camera alerts** → confirms issue **#38** (a dashboard-hidden camera
  should also drop out of alerts/review).
- **HAVE:** React 19 (#22275), multiple GenAI providers (#22144), GenAI streaming/chat (#22152) —
  nurby already has these.
- Backlog/VERIFY: **[#22254]** auth/login audit logging (nurby has no anonymous login, but an
  auth audit trail is worth considering) · P3.

---

## Batch 10 (PRs 22098–21752) — coverage batch, no code change

0.17-beta era: attributes/secondary-model features (N/A — nurby has no object-attributes or
secondary-classifier concept), Hailo/ROCm/RF-DETR deps (N/A), lots of i18n/docs/misc.

Backlog / VERIFY worth a later look:
- **[#21936] RTSP stream timeout** — nurby uses **5s** (`stream.py:394-395` `stimeout/timeout;5000000`);
  Frigate raised theirs to 15s for slow cameras. A tuning tradeoff (longer = slower offline
  detection), so not changed blind — consider making it configurable · P3.
- **[#21893]** event/incident getting stuck (only checking current clip/snapshot) — compare to
  nurby incident finalization · P3.
- **[#21754]** add a live-snapshot/live-state tool to the chat agent · P3.
- **[#21932]** X-Frame-Time header on snapshot API, **[#21752]** offline-camera placeholder image · P3.
- HAVE: API events as Detections/Alerts by label (#21923 — nurby severity taxonomy R5).
